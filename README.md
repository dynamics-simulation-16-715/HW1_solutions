## Getting Started
All the homeworks are distributed as Jupyter notebooks. Follow these instructions to get everything set up.

1. Install Julia. Download v1.5.3 from the [Julia website](https://julialang.org/downloads/). Extract the binaries onto a stable location on your computer, and add the `/bin` folder to your system path.
2. Clone this repo, and open a terminal in the root directory
2. Start a Julia REPL in your terminal using `julia`. This should work as long as the binaries are on your system path.
3. Install the [IJulia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl) using the Julia package manager. In the REPL, enter the package manager using `]`, then enter `add IJulia` to add it to your system path.
4. In the REPL (hit backspace to exit the package manager), enter `using IJulia`
5. Launch the notebook using `notebook()` or `jupyterlab()`
